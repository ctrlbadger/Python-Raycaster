# Python-Raycaster
A vector based Raycaster made in pygame with a map editor.

Currently unfinished just working on the MapEditorSection at the moment. What's really holding it back is my need for Optimisation, whilst the language isn't ideal I'm a bit of a perfectionist so it's taking a while. Currently hardest challenge is Sector Creation.
